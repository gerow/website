        In another life<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> I had the (mis)fortune of working on a project where I needed to
        implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11">PKCS-11</a><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> library in
        C++<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> that acted as a shim to translate signature requests from PKCS-11's
        interface to that of a another service on the box available over D-Bus.
    </p>
    <p>
        If that last paragraph made sense to you then I'm so sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
        In either case, while going about making this horrible thing become a reality I ran into a fun bug that seemed
        to happen every so often. After the application loading the library had finished reading the certificates and
        keys provided by the library, and performed a signing operation, it would crash with a <code>SIGBUS</code> or a
        <code>SEGFAULT</code>. This was unusual, because it really wasn't meant to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        After an hour or so of hopless <code>printf</code> debugging I finally Did The Right Thing and reached for good
        old <code>gdb</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sure enough <code>gdb</code> caught the address fault, but (being somewhat unfamiliar with
        <code>gdb</code> at the time<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>) it took me a while to figure out <em>what</em>
        exactly was causing the address fault. Eventually I presented <code>gdb</code> with a query, whose response I
        hope to never see again.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
(gdb) print *$pc
Cannot access memory at address 0xe8e7a948
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        To translate: my program counter (the bit the CPU uses to keep track of where it's heading) was pointing to
        memory that isn't accessible. Understandably this makes it difficult for the CPU to figure out what the next
        instruction it should run is.
    </p>
    <p>
        After some more debugging (honestly I don't remember this part, but I'm sure it involved hitting my desk at
        least a few times an hour) I came to the realization that the thread that mysteriously was trying to execute
        memory that semed to have nothing behind it was coming from a worker thread from the GDBus library, a library
        that's part of GLib's <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gtk/gio/">GIO</a> set of libararies, that
        made using D-Bus <s>easy</s>easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Did GLib betray me? Are the GNOME devs actively out to eat my lunch by having GIO jump to wild far-flung
        addresses in an attempt to ruin my day? These questions can't possibly be answered, but what I do know is that
        we eventually have to get back to the title of this post, and we've reached that point now.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code><a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/manpages-dev/dlclose.3.en.html">dlclose()</a></code> is the
        deceptively pleasant and even banal sounding counterpart to
        <code><a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/manpages-dev/dlopen.3.en.html">dlopen()</a></code>. But
        don't be fooled, <code>dlclose()</code> hates you. It hates you, it hates your family, and it <em>will</em> eat
        your lunch if given the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
        You see, PKCS-11 was implemented as a C library meant to be dynamically opened with <code>dlopen()</code>, which
        was the style at the time<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. <code>dlopen()</code> helpfully loads an arbitrary
        <code>.so</code> file and its runtime dependencies into the current address space, and provides a handle to get
        functions within it. <code>dlclose()</code>, on the other hand, mercilessly rips the aforementioned
        <code>.so</code> file <em>and its dependencies</em> right out of mapped memory no matter how you or your
        dependencies feel about it<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Which brings us back to GLib. As it turns out, GLib's worker thread was still running when
        <code>dlclose()</code> was called on my library. So GLib messed up right? Well, I didn't really tell it its
        instructions might be unmapped right out from under it. And GLib doesn't have a way for me to tell it "hey, you
        got like 1 second, be ready to be completely unmapped from memory, sg ok?".
    </p>
    <p>
        And really, it's fair it doesn't do that. It's hard enough to write a C library that can handle all the weird
        edge cases around what process its workers are in, or how threads may or may not be working in any particular
        state. Add on top of that needing to have complex code to clean up all your state and prepare to be unmapped
        at any moment in time, just isn't worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heck, even widely used libraries that are, in theory, meant to be able to be properly <code>dlclose()</code>'d
        don't always get this right. Take <a
            href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencryptoki/mailman/message/34873512/">this example I found in
            openCryptoki</a> in which
        every time one <code>dlcose()</code>es the library a file descriptor is leaked<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        So how do we fix this? It's simple, never <code>dlclose()</code>. Just don't do it. I know you might think
        you're some Real Smart Programmer That Really Actually Knows What They're Doing, but even if you're right the
        benefits simply aren't there. Once you've <code>dlopen()</code>'d you've opened pandora's box, there's no way
        you're goin to cleanly stuff all those bits back inside. And what do you gain when you run
        <code>dlclose()</code> anyway? You maybe get back a few megabytes of <em>address space</em>. Not memory,
        <em>address space</em>. If you're on a 16 bit machine, sure save that address space (how the heck are you
        using a POSIX-compliant <code>dlclose()</code> to begin with?!?). But if you're in the modern 64-bit world you
        should never use <code>dlclose()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But what if you're in my unfortunate position where you're writing the poor little library that just wanted to
        live free with its instructions mapped until the day of <code>exit()</code>ing. Well it's pretty simple,
        actually, you just <code>dlopen()</code> the library that's being <code>dlopen()</code>'d.
    </p>
    <p>
        By doing this you bump the reference counter for your library and its dependencies and put an end to any
        possibility of your instruction space being unceremoniously unmapped out from under you again. Unless whatever
        application is using you is poorly written and is double (or triple!) closing your library for some reason. In
        that case, maybe just <code>dlopen()</code> yourself a few times. 10 should do.

        completely optional. musl, for exmaple, opts to take the "do nothing because we don't have to" approach. what
        some may consider an inefficiency in musl's implementation, I consider a strategy deep in wisdom (or laziness,
        but in this case it's serendipitous laziness)</p>
    <p id="7">[7] i have no idea if this was ever patched (i nih'd my way out of needing to use openCryptoki as you
        might guess from this post) but if you have a long-running process that happens to <code>dlopen()</code> and
        <code>dlclose()</code> openCryptoki over its lifetime and you're running into file descriptor exhaustions, you
        might want to fix that (or better yet, as mentioned above, just stop using <code>dlclose()</code>)
