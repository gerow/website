    <h1>Generating Fake Video Game Descriptions Using GPT-2</h1>
    <time datetime="2020-02-03">2020-02-03</time>
    <p>
        I put together <a href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2">a couple of python scripts</a> to fetch and clean up
        video game titles and descriptions from <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/games/">the Giant Bomb wiki</a> and
        fed them to GPT-2 in an attempt to generate some fake video game names and descriptions. The original intent
        here was mostly to generate things that sound silly, with the secondary use to <i>maybe</i> provide a prompt for
        things like game jams.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/api/">The Giant Bomb API</a> proved to make this super easy, and with some
        filtering to get rid of lower quality articles we are left with a decent corpus. From there I filtered out
        things that weren't text in the articles and used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2markdown/">the
            html2markdown library</a> to convert the articles to markdown. As it turns out, GPT-2 is pretty good at
        learning markdown syntax and actively uses headings and lists to pretty decent effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        I then used Max Wolof's fantastic article <a href="https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/">How To Make Custom
            AI-Generated Text With GPT-2</a> as a guide to teach GPT-2 to spit out video game titles and descriptions
        formatted as markdown. The article describes how to use a free GPU in Colab to train the model, so no need for
        fancy hardware to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the results, you can find them in <a
            href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2-examples/tree/HEAD/examples">my examples repo</a>. These results
        aren't curated in any way, and thus plenty of them are, uhh, <a
            href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/394.md">somewhat</a> <a
            href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/398.md">bad</a>. But some of them are
        pretty decent, at least if you're looking for a laugh. A few of my favorites:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/374.md">Another Day at the Beach</a>, with
        the summary being:
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            A beach house in an abandoned town.
        </p>

        <p>
            The player is lead to the beach by a mysterious old man. You can see the old man, but he does not speak. He
            simply has a large bag with the keys inside. The house is bugged.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/379.md#characters">Battle of Elba for the
            Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985.</a> (yes, that's the full name of the game) provides a decent example
        of how GPT-2 can often get stuck in repetition, with its list of characters switching back and forth between a
        character named "Elba" and a character named "Kael" with slightly different descriptions each time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/388.md">Battleship</a>, which is very much
        unlike the original board game.
    <blockquote>
        <p>Battleship is a turn-based strategy game, and the goal is to hold all the resources until the end.</p>

        <p>Battleship is a first-person shooter, and the game is set in a world of endless possibilities. The game
            features a large variety of ships and classes, with the player doing everything from defending a mine with a
            crew, to building a fleet of ships and running from a squadron of invaders.</p>

        <p>However, the player doesn't have to necessarily build a fleet of ships. If he wants, he can simply go to a
            planet and find a resource. Here, the player can either go and find the resource, or build his fleet of
            ships.</p>

        <p>The game is not simple, however, as in order to hold all resources, the player must go through the planet; he
            can't just sit there and wait as a resource is being produced.</p>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/393.md">New York, New York</a>, with the
        worryingly problematic description:
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The game is set in Manhattan and its inhabitants are mostly white. The game features a significant increase
            in violence due to the fact that the game is set in a city that is heavily multicultural.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/gerow/gbgpt2-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/396.md">The Legend of Zelda: The Minish
            Cap</a>, which of course is a real video game, but in this version of it you get to play as the cap itself.
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The Minish Cap is the game's protagonist. He is the protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, and acts as
            the game's central hero. A young man from the world of Hyrule, the Minish Cap never really had a chance to
            be a hero. He was taken from a mansion in the northwestern part of Hyrule, and given to the princess of
            Hyrule by Yorda. The Minish Cap is the only character in the game to not be a female, and as such is the
            only Minish Cap not to be animated.
        </p>
